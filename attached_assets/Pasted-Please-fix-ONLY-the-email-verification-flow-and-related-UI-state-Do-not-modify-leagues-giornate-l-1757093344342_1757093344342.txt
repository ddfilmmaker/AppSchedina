Please fix ONLY the email verification flow and related UI state. Do not modify leagues, giornate, leaderboard, Supercoppa/Coppa, scoring, or other features.

Issues to fix:
1) Clicking the verification link opens a generic login page and the app still shows “verifica la tua email”.
2) After successful verification, the “verify your email” banner does not clear.
3) There’s an interim screen that only shows a welcome message and a button to send the verification email — remove this screen and show a non-blocking banner instead.

Required behavior:
A) Server: GET /auth/verify?token=...
   - Validate token (exists, not used, not expired).
   - Set users.email_verified_at = now() and mark token used.
   - Redirect (302) to the main app URL with a success flag, e.g. ${APP_URL}/?verified=1
   - Return 4xx with a small HTML page if invalid/expired, with a link back to ${APP_URL}.

B) Client:
   - On app load, if URL has ?verified=1, show a success toast “Email verificata!” and remove the query param without reload (history.replaceState).
   - Make sure /api/auth/me includes current verification status; after redirect, refetch /api/auth/me so the banner disappears immediately when verified.
   - Replace any standalone “verify email” page with a small, dismissible banner shown only when auth.me.unverified === true, containing a “Reinvia email di verifica” link/button. This banner must not block navigation.

C) Resend verification email:
   - Keep the existing POST to trigger a resend.
   - On success, show toast “Ti abbiamo inviato una nuova email di verifica”.

D) Do not change auth rules or block login for unverified users. This task only fixes verification handling, redirect, banner state, and resend UX.

Acceptance:
- New signup receives an email; clicking the link marks verified server-side and redirects to /?verified=1.
- The app shows “Email verificata!” toast and the verification banner no longer appears.
- No interim page; only a small banner with “Reinvia email di verifica” for unverified users.
- All other features/pages remain unchanged.
