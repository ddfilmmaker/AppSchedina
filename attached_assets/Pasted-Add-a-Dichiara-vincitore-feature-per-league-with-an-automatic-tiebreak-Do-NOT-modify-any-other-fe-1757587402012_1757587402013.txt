Add a “Dichiara vincitore” feature per league with an automatic tiebreak. Do NOT modify any other features (giornate, extras, scoring rules, routes, auth, UI styles) beyond what’s listed here.

Goal
- Admin can declare the league winner with one button. If there’s a tie for 1st, resolve it automatically by using the last matchday points as tiebreak.

Behavior
- On the classifica/league page, show an admin-only button: “Dichiara vincitore”.
- When clicked:
  1) Determine current 1st place in the league leaderboard.
  2) If a single leader exists → declare that user.
  3) If multiple users are tied for 1st → apply tiebreak:
     • Compare only the points from the most recent COMPLETED/officially closed matchday in this league (the last giornata whose results were confirmed and points posted to the leaderboard).
     • Winner = tied user with the higher points on that last completed matchday.
     • If still tied, step back to the previous completed matchday and compare again, repeating until the tie breaks.
     • If all completed matchdays are exhausted and it’s still tied → prompt admin to pick manually among the tied users (small dropdown) and proceed.

- After winner is determined (auto or manual), POST to a new endpoint and persist.
- Show a small banner “Vincitore: {nickname}” and a trophy/badge next to the winner in the classifica.
- Once declared, hide/disable the admin button and show “Dichiarato il {date}”.
- Do NOT change any points or recompute standings; this only marks the winner.

API (add only this)
- POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/declare-winner
  Input: { winnerUserId?, tiebreak=true }
  Logic:
    • If winnerUserId provided → use it (admin manual override).
    • Else:
      - Compute current leaderboard; get top users.
      - If tie:
         iterate completed matchdays in reverse chronological order, comparing per-user points for each giornata until a single winner emerges.
      - Persist chosen winner.
  Response includes a short explanation string, e.g.:
    { winnerUserId, method: "tiebreak", detail: "Deciso su Giornata 34: 5 vs 3 punti" }
  Idempotent: if winner already set, return 200 and do nothing.

DB (minimal additive fields)
- leagues: winner_user_id (nullable), declared_winner_at (timestamptz nullable), winner_decision_detail (text nullable)
  Do NOT change other tables.

UI
- Add a trophy icon or “Vincitore” badge beside the winner in the classifica.
- If method = tiebreak, optionally show a tiny info tooltip with the decision detail.

Constraints
- Do NOT modify existing scoring logic for giornate or extras.
- Do NOT alter classifica aggregation except to display the winner badge.
- Keep changes small and localized.

Acceptance
- Single clear leader → button declares winner, persists, and shows badge.
- Tie for 1st → tiebreak uses last completed matchday, falls back to previous ones if needed, else admin chooses manually; winner persists and badge shows.
- Refresh shows winner state; re-clicking does nothing (idempotent).
- No regressions elsewhere.
