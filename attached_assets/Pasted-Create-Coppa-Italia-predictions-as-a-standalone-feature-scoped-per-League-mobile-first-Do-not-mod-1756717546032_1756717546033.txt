Visibility & lock rules

Admin can set/edit a deadline (lockAt) and force lock.

Before lock:

Each participant can view/edit only their pick.

After lock:

Picks are read-only and participants can see all other participants’ picks.

Admin can set the risultato ufficiale (vincitrice).

Scoring (added to the league’s general leaderboard when official result is confirmed):

Vincitrice corretta → +5.

API (add only these endpoints)

GET /api/extras/coppa/:leagueId

Returns: current user’s pick (if any), lockAt/isLocked, official winner (if set).

After lock: also include all participants’ picks.

POST /api/extras/coppa

Body: { leagueId, winner } — upsert per (leagueId, userId); allowed only before lock.

POST /api/extras/coppa/lock

Body: { leagueId, lockAt? } — admin set/update deadline; allow force lock.

POST /api/extras/coppa/results

Body: { leagueId, officialWinner } — admin-only; on confirm, award +5 to users who picked correctly.

DB (add minimal tables only; do not change existing ones)

coppa_bet: id, league_id, user_id, winner text, updated_at

Unique (league_id, user_id).

coppa_settings: league_id (PK), lock_at datetime, locked boolean, official_winner text, results_confirmed_at datetime.

Acceptance

From a League page I can open Coppa Italia.

Before lock I can select Vincitrice finale and save; reload shows my saved value.

After lock I see all participants’ picks (read-only).

Admin can set/edit deadline, lock, then set official winner; points (+5) are added to the general leaderboard on confirm.

No other part of the app changes (Pre-Season and Supercoppa remain exactly as they are; league/matchday/picks/leaderboard unaffected).

Build passes with no import/route/type errors.
